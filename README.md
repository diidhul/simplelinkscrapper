# simplelinkscrapper
 Autonomous link scrapper by given list from xls using python

## Main idea from this project

My boss has assigned me a task to find 1000 links to templates with various titles. Doing this manually would be extremely time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, I have developed this project to streamline and expedite the completion time.

The code within this repository is an extension of the work done by several GitHub users, which I have further developed.
